  women's football team took the pitch for the UEFA Women's Euro Championship,

**Group Stage Domination!**

The Lionesses started strong, facing Austria in the opening match. It was a tense battle, but a goal by the fabulous Beth Mead secured a **1-0** victory!

Next up were the mighty Norwegians. The Lionesses roared into action, with an **UNBELIEVABLE 8-0** win! There were hat-tricks from both Ellen White and Lauren Hemp, plus goals from Fran Kirby and Georgia Stanway.

In England's final group game they continued to excel beating Northern Ireland **5-0**. Goals were scored by Russo, Mead and Kirby.

**Stellar Showdowns in the Knockouts!**

The knockout stages brought even tougher challenges. In the quarter-finals, Spain put up a great fight. The Lionesses went a goal down, but substitute Ella Toone popped up with a dramatic late equaliser! Then, wonder woman Georgia Stanway blasted a rocket of a shot in extra time to send England through to the last four with a **2-1** win!

Sweden awaited England in the semi-finals. This was a game of pure skill and determination. The Lionesses came out on top with a convincing **4-0** win, thanks to goals from Mead (again!), Hemp, Bronze and Russo (**THE** back heel of the century).

**Wembley Roars: The Historic Final!**

The stage was set â€“ the Euro 2022 Final at Wembley Stadium! England faced their old rivals, Germany. The match was a nail-biter, with both teams going toe-to-toe. Ella Toone chipped a cheeky goal over the goalkeeper to put England ahead, but Germany wouldn't give up and equalised. Just when it looked like penalties would decide the winner, substitute Chloe Kelly poked the ball home in extra time to send Wembley into a frenzy! England had won **2-1** and were crowned **EURO CHAMPIONS** for the very first time!
